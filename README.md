# Flashloan tool box

On flashloans: [aave](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/flash-loans).

This project is based off the aave brownie mix [here](https://github.com/brownie-mix/aave-flashloan-mix), and the difference is this is using forge and more `rust` focused design.

Will start off writing nodejs scripts + testing, then move over to `ether-rs`.
